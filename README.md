# udacity-boston-housing

This project is designed to get you acquainted to working with datasets in Python and applying basic machine learning techniques using NumPy and Scikit-Learn. Before being expected to use many of the available algorithms in the sklearn library, it will be helpful to first practice analyzing and interpreting the performance of your model.

Things you will learn by completing this project:

- How to use NumPy to investigate the latent features of a dataset.
- How to analyze various learning performance plots for variance and bias.
- How to determine the best-guess model for predictions from unseen data.
- How to evaluate a modelâ€™s performance on unseen data using previous data.
